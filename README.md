A game for kids by kids

## How to play
Open the index.html file with any browser.
Use the arrow keys to fly the "pig" through the obstacles.

## How to setup for development
Make sure you have installed Typescript on your computer by following these steps 
here:  https://www.typescriptlang.org/#installation

For Github you can use the command line or install the desktop application
here:  https://desktop.github.com

### Building and running changes
The code is _compiled_ from typescript files into a single file called: _main.js_
All the code lives in the _typescript_ folder.

#### To compile
1. Open a terminal.
2. Change to the directory, using the _cd_ command where you have the repository.
3. Change to the typescript directory (again using the _cd_ command).
4. Type _**tsc**_.
* Any errors will appear in the terminal.

This should compile a new file called:  _main.js_
Check the version of _main.js_ by running this command in the 
terminal:  `ls -l ..\main.js`

If the time/date stamp is within a minute the code was updated
